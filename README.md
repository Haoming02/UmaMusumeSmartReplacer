## How To Use
1. Place the script anywhere (Recommanded to put it into its own folder.)
2. Double click the script to open the UI
3. Enter the charater ID and Hash of file A and B
4. The program will automatically create a backup of both file A and B in the current folder
5. File A will then be replaced by file B with the correct edited IDs
- Clicking Restore will revert the change (Requires File A's Hash)
## Notices
- An example is given in the file.
- The 3 PATHs variables are automatically determined. No need to change them unless you also modify the **Initialize** part.
